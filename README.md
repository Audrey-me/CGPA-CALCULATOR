# CGPA-CALCULATOR
A program that accepts cgp of students in two different universities(UOP and MAU)
UOP uses the cumulative percentage grade system(CPGS) while MAU uses Cumulative grade point system(CGPA)
The program can accept percentage or CGPA and must collect one input which must be a string,then returns 'dear student your CPGA is X and you are a Y student
the Y represents the degree(first class, second class etc) while X is the CGPA in 2 decimal paces
if a user inputs  their percentage grade the program converts it to CGPA(ie X)
